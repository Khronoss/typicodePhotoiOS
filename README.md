# typicodePhotoiOS
Technical test in which I'm asked to build an iOS app that displays photos and photo albums from Typicode's fake JSON API

## Compiling & runing
The project targets iOS 13 minimum

I chose to not version the Pods folder, so you have to run `pod install` before trying to compile the project
